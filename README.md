Over the past few days, I've been diving deep into Android development with Kotlin, and I'm thrilled to announce the launch of my very own Wallpaper app called Wallify! ðŸ“±âœ¨
From Day 23 to Day 28/30 of my Android development journey. It's been an incredible learning experience filled with challenges and triumphs, but seeing the final product come to life has made it all worthwhile.
Wallify isn't just another Wallpaper app â€“ it's a reflection of my dedication to mastering Kotlin and creating something meaningful. It has a sleek user interface and a vast collection of stunning wallpapers.
My learning methodology is very experimental in making this app, I have used on-the-fly technique to seek new concepts either be it from youtube or the web(stackoverflow, google developers, etc..) and implemented 
those inferences in my very own way. There were few challenges in making it like following clean code, clean architecture, how to implement paging and others, and there are still things I have to conquer and master 
within this project and I'm trying to make do of it.
